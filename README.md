## Status

**`Work In progress`**
> *Still working with prototype prints - July 2024*

## About
<!-- DESCRIPTION START -->
This is the CAD repository for the PMPi Project's Case, a wireless PM2813 GPIB Controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico W.

Please refer to the [parent repository](https://github.com/LeHuman/PMPi)
<!-- DESCRIPTION END -->

### Note

Due to the binary nature of CAD files, version control is just copy/paste of entire files. Because of this, earlier versions have been lost and history on this repository may be purged to reduce repository size.

## Usage

This project is made in Solidworks. Look at the release page for a STEP file version of this project.

The project was prototyped against [JLC3DP](https://jlc3dp.com/)'s manufacturing capabilities. It is not necessary designed for mass manufacturing, as cosmetic defects will still occur.

### Note

To reduce file size, the top assembly is saved with suppressed components. Solidworks is old and weird.

### Requirements

- [Solidworks](https://www.solidworks.com/) >= 2023 SP2.1
